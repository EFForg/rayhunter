Rayhunter is a project for detecting IMSI catchers, also known as cell-site simulators or stingrays. It's designed to run on a cheap mobile hotspot called the Orbic RC400L, but thanks to community efforts can [support some other devices as well](./supported-devices.md).

It's also designed to be as easy to install and use as possible, regardless of you level of technical skills. This guide should provide you all you need to acquire a compatible device, install Rayhunter, and start catching IMSI catchers.
