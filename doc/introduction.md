Rayhunter is a project for detecting IMSI catchers, also known as cell-site simulators or stingrays. It's designed to run on a cheap mobile hotspot called the Orbic RC400L, but thanks to community efforts can [support some other devices as well](./supported-devices.md).

It's also designed to be as easy to install and use as possible, regardless of your level of technical skills. This guide should provide you all you need to acquire a compatible device, install Rayhunter, and start catching IMSI catchers.

To learn more about the aim of the project, and about IMSI catchers in general, please check out our [introductory blog post](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/03/meet-rayhunter-new-open-source-tool-eff-detect-cellular-spying). Otherwise, check out the [installation guide](./installation.md) to get started.
