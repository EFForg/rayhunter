# REST API Documentation

The rayhunter daemon has [REST API documentation](./api-docs/) available in the interactive swagger-ui.

>**Note:** API endpoints are subject to change as needs arise, though we will try to keep them as stable as possible and notify about breaking changes in the changelogs for new versions.
