# Configuration

Rayhunter can be configured by editing `/data/rayhunter/config.toml` on the device. You can obtain a shell on [orbic](./orbic.md#obtaining-a-shell) and [tplink](./tplink-m7350.md#obtaining-a-shell) and edit the file manually. In future versions the web UI will allow you to edit the config as well.

View the [default configuration file on GitHub](https://github.com/EFForg/rayhunter/blob/main/dist/config.toml.example).
