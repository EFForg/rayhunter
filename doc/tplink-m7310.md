# TP-Link M7310

Supported in Rayhunter since version 0.4.0.

The TP-Link M7310 works similarly to the [M7350](./tplink-m7350.md) and is
essentially an older, more expensive version of it. The installation procedure
is identical, `./installer tplink`.

Hardware version v1.0 has been successfully tested, later versions may work as
well.
