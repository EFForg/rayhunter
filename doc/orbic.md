# Orbic RC400L

The Orbic RC400L is an inexpensive LTE modem primarily designed for the US market, and the original device for which Rayhunter is developed.

You can buy an Orbic [using bezos

## The Network Installer

Since Rayhunter 0.6.0 there is an alternative, experimental installation
procedure at `./installer orbic-network` that is supposed to eventually replace
`./installer orbic`. It does not require any USB driver installation and works
identically on Windows, Mac and Linux. From our testing it works much more
reliably on Windows than `./installer orbic` does.

The drawback is that the device's admin password is required. If you have a Kajeet-branded "SmartSpot" you currently have to use the USB-based `./installer orbic`, as we currently don't know of a way to get that admin password.

1. Connect to the Orbic's network via WiFi or USB tethering
2. Run `./installer orbic-network`
3. The installer will ask you to log into the admin UI on `localhost:4000`. The password for that is the same as the WiFi password.
4. As soon as you're logged in, the installer will continue and reboot the device.

## Obtaining a shell

After running through the installation procedure, you can obtain a root shell
by running `adb shell` or `./installer util shell`. Then, inside of that shell
you can run `/bin/rootshell` to obtain "fakeroot."

If you are using the network installer, there will not be a rootshell and ADB will not be enabled by the installer. Instead you can use `./installer util orbic-start-telnet` and connect to the hotspot using `nc 192.168.1.1 23`. On Windows you might not have `nc` and will have to use WSL for that.
