# Orbic/Kajeet RC400L

The Orbic RC400L is an inexpensive LTE modem primarily designed for the US market, and the original device for which Rayhunter is developed.

It is also sometimes sold under the brand Kajeet RC400L. This is the exact same hardware and can be treated the same. 

You can buy an Orbic [using bezos
bucks](https://www.amazon.com/Orbic-Verizon-Hotspot-Connect-Enabled/dp/B08N3CHC4Y),
or on [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=orbic+rc400l).

[Please check whether the Orbic works in your country](https://www.frequencycheck.com/countries/), and whether the Orbic RC400L supports the right frequency bands for your purpose before buying.

## Supported Bands

| 5G (wideband,midband,nationwide)  | n260/n261, n77, n2/5/48/66 |
| 4G |    2/4/5/12/13/48/66       |
| Global & Roaming | n257/n78     |
| Wifi 2.4Ghz | b/g/n |
| Wifi 5Ghz | a/ac/ax |
| Wifi 6 | ðŸ®± |

## Two kinds of installers

The orbic's installation routine underwent many different changes:

1. The ADB-based shellscript prior to version 0.3.0
2. The Rust-based, ADB-based installer since version 0.3.0
3. Then, starting with 0.6.0, an alternative installer `./installer
   orbic-network` that is supposed to work more reliably, can run over the
   Orbic's WiFi connection and without the need to manually install USB drivers
   on Windows.
4. Starting with 0.8.0, `orbic-network` has been renamed to `orbic`, and the
   old `./installer orbic` is now called `./installer orbic-usb`.
   
It's possible that many tutorials out there still refer to some of the old
installation routines.

## The Network Installer

Since Rayhunter 0.6.0 there is an alternative, experimental installation
procedure at `./installer orbic-network` that is supposed to eventually replace
`./installer orbic`. It does not require any USB driver installation and works
identically on Windows, Mac and Linux. From our testing it works much more
reliably on Windows than `./installer orbic` does.

The drawback is that the device's admin password is required. 

1. Connect to the Orbic's network via WiFi or USB tethering
2. Run `./installer orbic-network --admin-password 'mypassword'`

   * On Verizon Orbic, the password is the WiFi password.
   * On Kajeet/Smartspot devices, the default password is `$m@rt$p0tc0nf!g`
   * On Moxee-brand devices, check under the battery for the password.
   * You can reset the password by pressing the button under the back case until the unit restarts.

3. The installer will eventually reboot the device, at which point the device is up and running.

## Obtaining a shell

After running the installer, there will not be a rootshell and ADB will not be
enabled. Instead you can use `./installer util orbic-start-telnet` and connect
to the hotspot using `nc 192.168.1.1 24`. On Windows you might not have `nc`
and will have to use WSL for that.

If you are using an installer prior to 0.7.0 or `orbic-usb` explicitly, you can
obtain a root shell by running `adb shell` or `./installer util shell`. Then,
inside of that shell you can run `/bin/rootshell` to obtain "fakeroot."
