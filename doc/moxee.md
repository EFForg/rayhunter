# KonnectONE Moxee Hotspot (K779HSDL)

Supported in Rayhunter since version 0.6.0.

The Moxee Hotspot is a device very similar to the Orbic RC400L. It seems to be
primarily for the US market.

**These devices have relatively little storage. The Orbic is usually a better alternative, though might be more expensive.**
