# TP-Link M7350

The TP-Link M7350 is **supported by Rayhunter since 0.3.0**. TP-Link M7350 supports many more frequency bands than Orbic and therefore works in Europe and also in some Asian and African countries.

## Hardware versions

The TP-Link comes in many different *hardware versions*. Support for installation varies:

* `1.0`, `2.0`: **Not supported**, devs are not able to obtain a device
* `3.0`, `3.2`, `5.0`, `5.2`, `7.0`, `8.0`: **Tested, no known issues since 0.3.0.**
* `6.2`: **One user reported it is working, not tested**
* `4.0`: **Manual firmware downgrade required** ([issue](https://github.com/EFForg/rayhunter/issues/332))
* `9.0`: **Working since 0.3.2.**

TP-Link versions newer than `3.0` have cyan packaging and a color display. Version `3.0` has a one-bit display and white packaging.

You can find the exact hardware version of each device under the battery or next to the barcode on the outer packaging, for example `V3.0` or `V5.2`. 

When filing bug reports, particularly with the installer, please always specify the exact hardware version.

You can get your TP-Link M7350 from:

* First check for used offers on local sites, sometimes it's much cheaper there.

* [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=tp-link+m7350&_sacat=0&_from=R40&_trksid=p4432023.m570.l1313)

## Installation & Usage

Follow the [release installation guide](./installing-from-release.md). Substitute `./installer orbic` for `./installer tplink` in other documentation. The Rayhunter UI will be available at [http://192.168.0.1:8080](http://192.168.0.1:8080).

## Obtaining a shell

Unlike on Orbic, the installer will not enable ADB. Instead, you can obtain a root shell with the following command:

```sh
./installer util tplink-start-telnet
telnet 192.168.0.1
```

## Display states

If your device has a color display, Rayhunter will show the same red/green/white line at the top of the display as it does on Orbic, each color meaning "warning"/"recording"/"paused" respectively. See [Using Rayhunter](./using-rayhunter.md).

If your device has a one-bit (black-and-white) display, Rayhunter will instead show an emoji to indicate status:

* `!` means "warning (potential IMSI catcher)"
* `:)` (smiling) means "recording"
* `:` (face with no mouth) means "paused"

## Power-saving mode/sleep

By default the device will go to sleep after N minutes of no devices being connected. In that mode it will also turn off connections to cell phone towers.
In order for Rayhunter to record continuously, you have to turn off this sleep mode in TP-Link's admin panel (go to **Advanced** - **Power Saving**) or keep e.g. your phone connectd on the TP-Link's WiFi.

## Port triggers

On hardware revisions starting with v4.0, the installer will modify settings to
add two port triggers. You can look at `Settings > NAT Settings > Port
Triggers` in TP-Link's admin UI to see them.

1. One port trigger "rayhunter-root" to launch the telnet shell. This is only needed for installation, and can be removed after upgrade. You can reinstall it using `./installer util tplink-start-telnet`.
2. One port trigger "rayhunter-daemon" to auto-start rayhunter on boot. If you remove this, rayhunter will have to be started manually from shell.
