# Supported devices

Rayhunter was built and tested primarily on the Orbic RC400L mobile hotspot, but the community has been working hard at adding support for other devices. Theoretically, if a device runs a Qualcomm modem and exposes a `/dev/diag` interface, Rayhunter may work on it.

If you have a device in mind which you'd like Rayhunter to support, please [open a discussion on our Github](https://github.com/EFForg/rayhunter/discussions)!

## Tier 1 - Fully supported devices
These devices have been extensively tested by the core developers and are widely used. We recommend running Rayhunter on one of these devices if you can.
- [Orbic RC400L](./orbic.md)
- [TP-Link M7350](./tplink-m7350.md)
- [TP-Link M7310](./tplink-m7310.md)

## Tier 2 - Functional devices
Some developers have succeeded in getting Rayhunter running on these devices, but they have not received the same level of adoption as tier 1 devices.
