# Supported devices

Rayhunter was built and tested primarily on the Orbic RC400L mobile hotspot, but the community has been working hard at adding support for other devices. Theoretically, if a device runs a Qualcomm modem and exposes a `/dev/diag` interface, Rayhunter may work on it.

If you have a device in mind which you'd like Rayhunter to support, please [open a discussion on our Github](https://github.com/EFForg/rayhunter/discussions)!

## Orbic RC400L

You can buy an Orbic [using bezos
bucks](https://www.amazon.com/Orbic-Verizon-Hotspot-Connect-Enabled/dp/B08N3CHC4Y),
or on [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=orbic+rc400l).

[Please check whether the Orbic works in your country](https://www.frequencycheck.com/countries/), and whether the Orbic RC400L supports the right frequency bands for your purpose before buying.

## TPLink M7350 HW rev. 3, 5, 9

There is work underway to support [TP-Link M7350](https://github.com/EFForg/rayhunter/issues/186) to support more frequency bands and therefore support most of Europe.
