# Supported devices

Rayhunter was built and tested primarily on the Orbic RC400L mobile hotspot, but the community has been working hard at adding support for other devices. Theoretically, if a device runs a Qualcomm modem and exposes a `/dev/diag` interface, Rayhunter may work on it.

If you have a device in mind which you'd like Rayhunter to support, please [open a discussion on our Github](https://github.com/EFForg/rayhunter/discussions)!
