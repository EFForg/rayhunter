# Supported devices

## Recommended devices

These devices have been extensively tested by the core developers and are widely used. We recommend running Rayhunter on one of these devices if you can.

- [Orbic RC400L](./orbic.md)
- [TP-Link M7350](./tplink-m7350.md)

If you are in the US, use the Orbic. TP-Link M7350 also works but is usually more expensive to obtain. Otherwise use TP-Link M7350.

## Other devices

These devices are also supported but less commonly used. We do not recommend getting them for this purpose unless you already have one.

- [TP-Link M7310](./tplink-m7310.md)
- [Wingtech CT2MHS01](./wingtech-ct2mhs01.md)

Theoretically, if a device can be rooted, runs a Qualcomm modem and exposes a `/dev/diag` interface, Rayhunter may work on it. If you have a device in mind which you'd like Rayhunter to support, please [open a discussion on our Github](https://github.com/EFForg/rayhunter/discussions)!
