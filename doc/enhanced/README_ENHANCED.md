### üìã Installation

#### **Option 1: Docker Environment (Recommended for New Users)**

The Docker environment provides a complete, isolated build environment with all dependencies pre-configured:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/rayhunter-enhanced.git
cd rayhunter-enhanced

# Start Docker environment
./docker-build.sh up
./docker-build.sh shell

# Inside container - simple 3-step process
./setup_ubuntu_ci.sh     # Install toolchains & dependencies
./fetch_source.sh        # Download latest source code (if needed)
./build_and_deploy.sh    # Build and deploy to device
```

**Docker Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Isolated environment** - No system modifications required
- ‚úÖ **All dependencies included** - Ubuntu 22.04 with full toolchain
- ‚úÖ **Persistent storage** - Work survives container restarts
- ‚úÖ **Cross-compilation ready** - ARM toolchain pre-configured
- ‚úÖ **adb support** - Direct device deployment via USB

#### **Option 2: Ubuntu Users (Automated Setup)**

For Ubuntu systems, use the automated setup scripts:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/rayhunter-enhanced.git
cd rayhunter-enhanced

# Set up build environment (one-time setup)
./setup_ubuntu_ci.sh     # Automated setup for CI/CD
# OR
./setup_ubuntu_build_env.sh  # Interactive setup for development

# Build everything and deploy
./build_all.sh && ./deploy.sh
```

#### **Option 3: Local Dependencies (No Root Required)**

Install all dependencies locally without affecting your system:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/rayhunter-enhanced.git
cd rayhunter-enhanced

# Install all dependencies locally (no root access needed)
./setup_local_deps.sh

# Build everything and deploy
./build_all.sh && ./deploy.sh
```

**Local Dependencies Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **No root access required**
- ‚úÖ **Isolated environment** - doesn't affect system
- ‚úÖ **Reproducible builds** - exact versions for everyone
- ‚úÖ **Easy cleanup** - just delete `./build_deps` directory

#### **Option 4: Manual Installation**

For other systems or custom setups:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/rayhunter-enhanced.git
cd rayhunter-enhanced

# 1. Setup Rust cross-compilation
rustup target add armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf

# 2. Install ARM cross-compilation toolchain
# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf
# macOS: brew install arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc
# Other systems: see BUILD_GUIDE.md

# 3. Build web interface
cd bin/web && npm install && npm run build && cd ../..

# 4. Build for device
cargo build --profile firmware --target armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf

# 5. Deploy to device via ADB
./deploy.sh
```

### üß™ Verify Build Environment

Test that your cross-compilation environment is working correctly:

```bash
# Test cross-compilation setup
./test_cross_compilation.sh

# This verifies:
# - Build scripts compile for host architecture
# - Target binaries compile for ARM
# - No compiler conflicts
```

### üîç How It Works

#### **Data Collection**
Rayhunter interfaces with the cellular modem's diagnostic interface to capture detailed network information, including:

- **Cell tower information** and network parameters
- **Signal strength measurements** and quality metrics
- **Network registration events** and location updates
- **Neighbor cell discoveries** and handoff information

#### **Analysis Engine**
The system analyzes captured data to detect:

1. **Inconsistent network behavior** that may indicate rogue base stations
2. **Signal anomalies** that deviate from expected patterns
3. **Location tracking attempts** through area code monitoring
4. **Suspicious cell configurations** not matching known networks

#### **Output Formats**
- **PCAP files**: Network packet captures for Wireshark analysis
- **QMDL files**: Raw cellular diagnostic logs
- **CSV exports**: Structured data for spreadsheet analysis
- **JSON data**: Machine-readable format for custom analysis

#### **Submit GPS Coordinates**
```bash
# Using curl (GET method - GPS2REST-Android compatible)
curl "http://192.168.1.1:8080/api/v1/gps/37.7749,-122.4194"

# Using curl (POST method)
curl -X POST "http://192.168.1.1:8080/api/v1/gps/37.7749,-122.4194"
```

If commands are not found:
```bash
# For Docker environment
./docker-build.sh shell

# For local setup
./setup_local_deps.sh    # No root required
# OR
./setup_ubuntu_ci.sh     # System-wide (requires sudo)
```

#### **Build Failures**
For persistent build issues:
