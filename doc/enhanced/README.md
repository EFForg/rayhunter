### üìã Installation

#### **Option 1: Docker Environment (Recommended for New Users)**

The Docker environment provides a complete, isolated build environment with all dependencies pre-configured:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/rayhunter-enhanced.git
cd rayhunter-enhanced

# Start Docker environment
./docker-build.sh up
./docker-build.sh shell

# Inside container - simple 3-step process
./setup_ubuntu_ci.sh     # Install toolchains & dependencies
./fetch_source.sh        # Download latest source code (if needed)
./build_and_deploy.sh    # Build and deploy to device
```

**Docker Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Isolated environment** - No system modifications required
- ‚úÖ **All dependencies included** - Ubuntu 22.04 with full toolchain
- ‚úÖ **Persistent storage** - Work survives container restarts
- ‚úÖ **Cross-compilation ready** - ARM toolchain pre-configured
- ‚úÖ **adb support** - Direct device deployment via USB

#### **Option 2: Ubuntu Users (Automated Setup)**

For Ubuntu systems, use the automated setup scripts:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/rayhunter-enhanced.git
cd rayhunter-enhanced

# Set up build environment (one-time setup)
./setup_ubuntu_ci.sh     # Automated setup for CI/CD

# Build everything and deploy
./build_all.sh && ./deploy.sh
```

#### **Option 3: Local Dependencies (No Root Required)**

Install all dependencies locally without affecting your system:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/rayhunter-enhanced.git
cd rayhunter-enhanced

# Install all dependencies locally (no root access needed)
./setup_local_deps.sh

# Build everything and deploy
./build_all.sh && ./deploy.sh
```

### üì± GPS API Usage

#### **Submit GPS Coordinates**
```bash
# Using curl (GET method - GPS2REST-Android compatible)
curl "http://192.168.1.1:8080/api/v1/gps/37.7749,-122.4194"

# Using curl (POST method)
curl -X POST "http://192.168.1.1:8080/api/v1/gps/37.7749,-122.4194"
```

#### **Download GPS Data**
```bash
# Get GPS data for a recording session
curl "http://192.168.1.1:8080/api/gps/1720080123/csv" -o gps_data.csv
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Build System Enhancements

#### **Cross-Compilation Improvements**
The build system has been enhanced with comprehensive cross-compilation fixes:

- ‚úÖ **Proper host/target separation** - Build scripts compile for host (x86_64), target binaries for ARM
- ‚úÖ **PATH management** - Ensures correct compiler resolution
- ‚úÖ **Environment isolation** - Prevents ARM compiler from interfering with build scripts
- ‚úÖ **Automatic verification** - Tests cross-compilation setup before building

#### **Available Build Scripts**
- **`./build_all.sh`** - Comprehensive build with environment detection and verification
- **`./make.sh`** - Quick build for iterative development
- **`./clean.sh`** - Clean all build artifacts and prepare for fresh build
- **`./deploy.sh`** - Deploy to device via adb
- **`./test_cross_compilation.sh`** - Verify cross-compilation environment

### üêõ Troubleshooting

#### **Cross-Compilation Issues**
If you encounter ARM linker errors:
```bash
# Test your environment
./test_cross_compilation.sh

# Clean and rebuild
./clean.sh && ./build_all.sh
```

#### **Environment Issues**
If commands are not found:
```bash
# For Docker environment
./docker-build.sh shell

# For local setup
./setup_local_deps.sh    # No root required
# OR
./setup_ubuntu_ci.sh     # System-wide (requires sudo)
```
