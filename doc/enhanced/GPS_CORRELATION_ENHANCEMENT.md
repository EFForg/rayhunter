# GPS Correlation Enhancement

## Overview

The GPS Correlation Enhancement adds location awareness to Rayhunter's analysis results. This feature correlates cellular network events with GPS coordinates based on timestamps, providing geographical context for security analysis.

## Features

### üéØ **Enhanced Analysis Output**
- **GPS Correlation**: Each analysis event now includes GPS coordinates when available
- **Accuracy Metrics**: Correlation accuracy based on timestamp proximity
- **Time Difference Tracking**: Shows how close the GPS data is to the analysis timestamp
- **Correlation Statistics**: Overall GPS coverage and correlation rates

### üìç **Location-Aware Security Analysis**
- **Geographic Context**: See where cellular events occurred
- **Movement Tracking**: Track device location during analysis
- **Area Analysis**: Identify patterns in specific geographic areas
- **Correlation Methods**: Multiple correlation algorithms for different use cases

## How It Works

### 1. **Data Collection**
- GPS coordinates are collected via REST API during recording sessions
- Each recording session gets its own GPS file with the same timestamp
- GPS data is stored in `/data/rayhunter/captures/{timestamp}.gps`

### 2. **Analysis Correlation**
- During analysis, the system loads the corresponding GPS file
- For each analysis event, it finds the closest GPS coordinate by timestamp
- GPS data within 30 seconds of the analysis timestamp is correlated
- Accuracy is calculated based on time proximity

### 3. **Enhanced Output**
- Analysis results include GPS correlation data
- Each event shows latitude, longitude, accuracy, and correlation method
- Statistics show overall GPS coverage and correlation success rate

## Enhanced Analysis Structure

### GPS Correlation Data
```json
{
  "gps_correlation": {
    "latitude": 37.7749,
    "longitude": -122.4194,
    "accuracy_meters": 10.0,
    "correlation_method": "closest_timestamp",
    "time_difference_seconds": 2
  }
}
```

### Analysis Statistics
```json
{
  "gps_stats": {
    "total_gps_entries": 150,
    "correlated_events": 142,
    "correlation_rate": 94.67,
    "gps_time_span": "45 minutes"
  }
}
```

## Usage

### 1. **Collect GPS Data**
Submit GPS coordinates during recording:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/gps/37.7749,-122.4194
```

### 2. **Run Analysis**
Analysis automatically includes GPS correlation when GPS data is available:
- Web UI: Click "Analyze" on any recording
- API: Use the analysis endpoint
- The system automatically detects and loads GPS data

### 3. **View Results**
Enhanced analysis results include:
- **Location Data**: GPS coordinates for each event
- **Accuracy Information**: How reliable the correlation is
- **Correlation Statistics**: Overall GPS coverage metrics

## Configuration

### GPS Correlation Settings
- **Time Tolerance**: 30 seconds (configurable)
- **Accuracy Levels**:
  - High (‚â§5s): 10m accuracy
  - Medium (‚â§15s): 50m accuracy  
  - Low (‚â§30s): 100m accuracy
- **Correlation Methods**: Closest timestamp matching

### File Structure
```
/data/rayhunter/captures/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1752849167.qmdl      # Raw diagnostic data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1752849167.pcapng    # PCAP format
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1752849167.gps       # GPS coordinates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1752849167.ndjson    # Enhanced analysis with GPS correlation
