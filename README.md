Rayhunter is a project for detecting IMSI catchers, also known as cell-site simulators or stingrays. It was first designed to run on a cheap mobile hotspot called the Orbic RC400L, but thanks to community efforts can [support some other devices as well](https://efforg.github.io/rayhunter/supported-devices.md).
It's also designed to be as easy to install and use as possible, regardless of your level of technical skills, and to minimize false positives.
